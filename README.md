To use this application, simply open it in your browser and click the 'start quiz' button to begin. Follow the prompts on screen and select the question that you believe is correct. The quiz is timed and will countdown from 75 seconds when you begin the quiz. If you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the current time. When you complete the quiz, enter your initials and save your score to local storage.
